We are R-Ladies Paris, a network of R practitioners in Paris. We are a local chapter of a global open source community promoting gender inclusivity among R practitioners and learners, [R-Ladies Global](https://t.co/7HMQw0VGas).

Our goals are to provide a supportive and encouraging network for R users who are self-identified minorities and to promote learning and collaboration in the R community. We are open to anyone interested in programming in R, from experts to novices. Everyone is welcome to join us!

👯 We are always open to collaborate on R-related subjects!
